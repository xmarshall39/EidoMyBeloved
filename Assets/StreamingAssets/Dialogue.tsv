80	Wait a second, I feel a memory coming back to me, but it's fuzzy...		Confused	1	Village	Can you help me unscramble these letters?: LAG VIEL	A human child, around what would be middle school age, is walking through a coastal village, passing by older men carrying bundles of fish and older women harvesting the earliest of the year’s crops. Everyone looks happy and content, but when they look at you, there’s a look in their eyes. Pity? Disdain? Who knows.	Wallowing	Oh... I can't remember...	Crying
124	So... How'd you end up here? Either way, probably not that fun.		Wave	0						
130	I still don't remember much of how I got here. Or how I was before that.		Sad							
137	Wait, this feels all too farmiliar!		Wallowing	1	Ocean	What does it mean? AC ONE	You’re sitting with your mother, watching your father’s fishing boat sail out into the clear blue waters. You’re no older than 5 or 6 years old, the typical age where kids in your community start learning how to swim and sail in the hopes that they are able to contribute to their biggest export: fishing. Usually you and your mother sit quietly together, taking in the beauty of the little island you live on but today’s different. Today, you turn to her and ask her why your community relies on the ocean so much if it can be dangerous. She turns to you, smiles a little, and tells you that even though the ocean can indeed be scary and sometimes dangerous, it can also be peaceful and that as long as you learn to traverse it safely, leave it as clean as you found it, and don’t take more resources than you give, then you should be able to retain a balance with it. You nod, content with her answer, and silently vow to yourself to never upset the balance between you and the sea.	Sad	Why can't I remember? Why can't I at least be good at that?	Crying
167	Why am I still here? Do I like this place?		Confused							
180	“Oh it’s not that bad here! You get used to the loneliness after a while. That’s why I like to help out the incoming guides.”		Wave							
										
195	It's so weird that these memories have been flooding back. A whole lot like water. I feel like water was important to me...		Confused							
205	Woah, something's coming back to me!		Confused	1	Alone	What is the word? EOL AN	The storm around you rages. Through the onslaught of rain is blinding and the wind sends a chill through you. Looking around, you see the other crew members on your ship struggling to keep it afloat against the massive waves that are crashing into the side of your boat and flooding it with water. Today was supposed to be a normal expedition, nothing bad was supposed to happen, the storm wasn’t even forecasted but here you are, being tossed around like a pinball. An especially huge wave crashes into the port side and you, unable to keep your footing, are knocked overboard and fall into the dark water below. Upon making first contact with the freezing water, all the air is knocked out of your lungs as you flail frantically, trying to remain calm. You can still see the others on the boat trying to keep it upright and many of them look towards you but no one can seem to stop to help. Your father races to the railing and starts yelling at you to swim. You do, but only make it a few feet before another wave hits you in the face and the salt water burns your eyes. Your flailing gets more frantic now, as your body grows tired and you start sinking. Realizing that you won’t be able to make it back to the safety of the ship, you allow your tired body to rest. As you close your eyes and allow the waves to overtake you, the last thing you see is the memory of the smiling faces of your family as your vision goes black.	Wallowing	Oh... That felt really important...	Crying
245	Man, I've been getting a lot of memories lately... Are you like, a memory magician?		Wave							
240	Wait... Another memory, and more letters.		Confused	1	First	What is it? What is it? SRFTI	You’re back on the boat. The people around you aren’t happy about it because you aren’t known for being a great fisherman, even by children’s standards but your parents continue to take you out in an attempt to improve your skills. You all have been out in the hot sun for hours with no end in sight and the ship’s crew and your parents are watching on as you try, yet again, to catch something. The whole day, you either haven’t been getting any bites on your hook or, if something did bite, you weren’t able to reel it in. Discouraged, you cast your last hook of the day and wait. After a minute, it’s looking like another failure when all of a sudden, you feel it. A tug on the end of your fishing line. Your parents shout at you to reel the line in and you very quickly realize that this fish is bigger than anything you’ve tried to catch all day. A couple of the other boys on the expedition, only a little older than you, rush over to help you reel it in and, after a lot of strain and effort, a huge swordfish flops on the deck at your feet. You’ve done it. You’ve caught your first fish.	Wallowing	I'll never remember who I was. How could you.	Baffled
